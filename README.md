# Preschool-Math-Learning-System

A web-based educational application designed for preschool children to practice and reinforce foundational mathematics concepts in an engaging format. Built as part of a project for the Institutional Engineering Malaysia Club, this system allows young learners to interactively explore numbers, counting, simple addition/subtraction, and number recognition in a safe and friendly UI.  

## Key Features  
- Simple, intuitive interface tailored for preschool-aged users  
- Interactive number-based activities: counting objects, matching numbers, basic arithmetic  
- Visual and audio cues to support early learning and improve retention  
- Lightweight front-end, easy to deploy and maintain  

## Intended Users  
This system targets preschool learners, early childhood educators, and parental usage within the club’s outreach initiatives. It is an ideal tool for introducing young children to mathematical thinking in a playful way.  

## Technical Summary  
The implementation uses standard web technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), with DOM-based user interaction and state stored locally (e.g., via localStorage) for session persistence. The design focuses on simplicity, performance, and accessibility for very young users.

2. Open the `index.html` (or main HTML file) in a web browser to start the application.  
3. Use the form/interface to add, manipulate or track user progress.  
4. The application stores user activity locally, enabling simple session-based persistence.
